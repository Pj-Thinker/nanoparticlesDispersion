 Dispersion of nanoparticles in a microchannel
The continuum assumption of fluid mechanics is not suited for micro-scale problems. In other words, when the Knudsen number is close or greater than one, we can’t use the continuum mechanics formulation of fluid dynamics. The velocity profile in slip flow regime is assumed as below.

The pressure drop can be obtained from Darcy–Weisbach and mechanical energy balance equations.

The Drag, Saffman lift force, Brownian force, Buoyancy force and Gravitation force are considered in momentum equation. Discretization of momentum equation in x and y direction obtains the following.

Knowing the particle velocity, we can get its new position in each time step.
