 Dispersion of nanoparticles in a microchannel
The continuum assumption of fluid mechanics is not suited for micro-scale problems. In other words, when the Knudsen number is close or greater than one, we can’t use the continuum mechanics formulation of fluid dynamics. The Knudsen number is defined as below.
Kn=?/L
?=mean free path [L]
L=representative physical length scale [L]
